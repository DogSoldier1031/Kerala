“The extra portion, along with condiments, is placed on a banana leaf, tied up neatly as a pothichoru (food parcel) and wrapped in a sheet of newspaper for protection. Later, volunteers from the Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI), the youth wing of the state’s ruling Communist party (Marxist), will visit homes to collect the meals.
By noon, the parcels are being distributed among 40,000 patients in the state’s hospitals. In Indian hospitals, food is not provided free. Patients from poor families miss out on some meals because they cannot afford to pay.”

“So, how did such a society become a model for development and social reform? There were many movements that worked in tandem over a period of time, slowly eroding the old unjust power structures, and worked towards establishing a more equitable society. There were Communist governments that legislated radical reforms. Christian Missionaries preached equality, and set up schools and educational institutions in the state.  There were activists and social reformers who broke caste barriers and led their people out of bondage. There was also a benign royalty invested in the welfare of its people rather than its own pomp and grandeur.
…..
It was only in 1970, under the government formed by another CPI leader, Achutha Menon, that the historic Agrarian Reforms Bill was finally passed. This served as a death knell for the existing exploitative feudal system. The Agrarian Reforms Bill conferred ownership rights on land to all tenants, including sharecroppers. A ceiling on land ownership was fixed. Surplus land taken from landlords was distributed to the landless poor. EMS himself gave away many acres of his inherited land. Though the education bill was never successfully passed, its suggestions were incorporated in other legislation pertaining to education. And the fire had been lit.”
